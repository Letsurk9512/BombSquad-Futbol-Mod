<a href="http://www.froemling.net/apps/bombsquad">BombSquad</a> made by
<a href="http://www.froemling.net/about">Eric Froemling</a>

<h3>Description</h3>
This mod is avaliable for the *API 8 (1.7.20 to 1.7.36)*, so you can use 
it if you plays on these versions.

<h4>Info</h4>
This is a football minigame, consisting a ball, two football goals, and
can play 6 players (you can change it). It's too complete but it is a simply minigame.
